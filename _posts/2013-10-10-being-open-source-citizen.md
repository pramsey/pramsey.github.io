I was invited to deliver a keynote at [FOSS4G 2013 in Nottingham](http://2013.foss4g.org) last month, and in a twist it turned out to be a closing slot rather than an opening one. So rather than a call to action, I did something more moralistic, a "sermon" of sorts for everyone going home after a great conference.  And then the recording turned out to be no good. So I did it again a couple weeks later at the [Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com) company meeting in Denver.
