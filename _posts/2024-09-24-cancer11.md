What happened there, I didn't write for three months! Two words: "complications", and "recovery".

In a terrifying medical specialty like **cancer treatment**, one of the painful ironies is that patients spend a lot of time suffering from complications and side effects of the **treatments**, rather than the **cancer**. In my case and many others, the existence of the cancer isn't even **noticable** without fancy diagnostic machines. The treatments on the other hand... those are very noticable!

A lot of this comes with the territory of major surgery and dangerous chemicals. My surgery included specific possible complications including, but not limited to: incontinence, sexual disfunction, urinary disfunction, and sepsis. 

Fortunately, I avoided all the complications specific to my surgery. What I **did not** avoid was a surprisingly **common** complication of spending some time in a hospital while taking broad spectrum antibiotics--I contracted the "superbug" _clostridioides difficile_, aka _c.diff_.

Let me tell you, finding you have a "superbug" is a real bummer, and _c.diff_ lives up to its reputation. Like cancer, it is **hard to kill**, it does quite a bit of damage while it's in you, and the things that kill it **also** do a lot of damage to your body.

Killing my _c.diff_ required a couple of courses of specialized antibiotics (vancomycin), that in addition to killing the _c.diff_ **also** killed all the other beneficial bacteria in my lower intestine.

So, two months after surgery, I was recovering from:

* having my lower intestine handled and sliced in a major surgery
* having that same intestine populated with _c.diff_ and covered in _c.diff_ toxins
* having the microbiotic population living in my intestine nuked with a modern antibiotic developed to kill resistant superbugs

Not surprisingly, having all those things at once makes for a much longer recovery, and a pretty up-and-down one. My slowly recovering microbiota is in constant flux, which results in some really surprising symptoms.

* highly variable stomach discomfort (ok)
* highly variable appetite (makes sense)
* random days of fatigue (really?)
* random days of anxiety (what?!?)

I had not really understood the implications of gut/brain connection, until this journey showed me just how **tightly bound** my mental state was to the current condition of my guts. The anxiety I have experienced as a result of my _c.diff_ exposure has been worse, amazingly, than what I felt after my initial cancer diagnosis. One was in my head, but the other was **in my gut**.

I have also developed a much more acute sympathy for people suffering from long Covid and other chronic diseases. The actual symptoms are **bad enough**, but the psychological effect of the symptom variability is really hard to deal with.  Bad days follow good days, with no warning. I have mostly stopped voicing any optimism about my condition, because who knows what tomorrow will bring. 

When people ask me how I'm doing, I shrug.

One thing I have got going for me, that chronic disease sufferers do not, is a sense that I am in fact **improving**. I started journaling my symptoms early in the recovery process, and I can look back and see definitively that while things are unpredictable day to day, or even week to week, the long term trajectory is one of improvement.

Without that, I think I'd go loopy.

Anyways, I am now rougly three months out from my last course of antibiotics, and I expect it will be at least another three months before I'm firing on all cylinders again, thanks mostly to the surgical complication of acquiring _c.diff_. If I was just recovering from the surgery, I imagine I would be much closer to full recovery.
