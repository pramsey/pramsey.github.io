For [PostGIS Day](https://www.crunchydata.com/community/events/postgis-day-2024) this year I researched a little into one of my favourite topics, the history of relational databases. I feel like in general we do not pay a lot of attention to history in software development. To quote Yoda, "All his life has he looked awayâ€¦ to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on **where he was**. Hmm? What he was doing."

Anyways, this year I took on the topic of the early history of spatial databases in particular. There was a lot going on in the '90s in the field, and in many ways PostGIS was a late entrant, even though it gobbled up a lot of the user base eventually.
