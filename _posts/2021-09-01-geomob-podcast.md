I neglected to post about this at the time, which I guess is a testament to the power of twitter to suck up energy that might otherwise be used in blogging, but for posterity I am going to call out here:

* I got to go on the [GeoMob podcast and talk with Steven Feldman](https://thegeomob.com/podcast/episode-88) this spring.
* It was cool, Steven is a fellow "FOSS4G Chairpersons" alumnus, having chaired the [2013 edition](http://2013.foss4g.org/).
* We covered PostGIS, open source, and even a bit of electoral data and field ops.

Have a [listen](https://thegeomob.com/podcast/episode-88).
