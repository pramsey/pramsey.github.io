The British Columbia government's new "[eDrive](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2016PREM0133-002280)" rate for LNG producers is going to be creating new jobs at an ongoing cost of **$138,000 per job** at the electrically powered [Woodfibre LNG](http://www.woodfibrelng.ca/) plant in Squamish.

Let's do the math, shall we? Here's the input data:

* The Woodfibre plant will produce [**2,100,000 tonnes** of LNG per year](http://squamish.ca/business-and-development/economic-development/projects-in-our-community/woodfibre-lng-community-committee/).
* Using modern equipment, [it takes **230 kWh** of electricity to chill 1 tonne of LNG](http://wernerantweiler.ca/blog.php?item=2014-11-11).
* The price [BC originally set for electricity used for LNG](http://www.bcenergyblog.com/2014/11/articles/general-renewable-energy/connecting-to-the-grid-bc-sets-rates-terms-for-lng-industry/) was $83.02 per MWh, compared to a prevailing industrial rate of $54.34 per MWh. The new "eDrive" rate is actually just the industrial rate, so the announcement today amounts to a rate change of **$28.68 per MWh**.
* The Woodfibre facility will create **100 long-term jobs**. Since the cost of electricity inputs will also run for the lifespan of the facility, this seems like the right number to compare to.

Now the math:

* **2,100,000 tonnes** of LNG times
* 230 kWh of electricty is
* **483,000,000 kWh per year** of useage. Which can also be stated as
* 483,000 mWh per year. Times 
* $28.68 per mWh in eDrive subsidy equals
* **$13,852,440 per year** in foregone revenue for BC Hydro, which for
* 100 permanent jobs is
* **$138,524 per job**

If we want to create 100 new government-funded jobs:

* Why are we paying $138,524 for each of them; and,
* Why are they freezing methane, and not teaching kids or building transit or training new engineers.

Government is about choices, and this government is making some batshit crazy choices.
