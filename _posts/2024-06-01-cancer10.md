So, I got the news from pathology.

There is **no cancer** left in me, I am officially "cured". 

Since I am still recovering from surgery and relearning what my GI tract is going to do for the future, I don't **feel** entirely cured, but I do feel the **weight of wondering** about the future lifted off of me.

The future will not hold any more major cancer treatments, just annual screening colonoscopies, and getting better post-surgery.

I truly have had the snack-sized experience, not that I would recommend it to anyone. Diagnosed late February, spit off the back of the conveyor belt in late May. Three months in Cancerland, three months too many.

A few days ago NBA great [Bill Walton died](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/statement-dr-james-weber-ceo-141700262.html) of colorectal cancer. It's the second most common cancer in both men and women, and you can avoid a trip to Cancerland through the simple expedient of [getting screened](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-screening/art-20046825). Don't skip it because you are young, rates amount people under 50 are going up at a great rate (there's something in the [environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10340669/), probably).
