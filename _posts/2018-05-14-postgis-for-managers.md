I presented my "PostGIS for Managers" talk for the last time (at least in this form) today at [FOSS4G North America](https://2018.foss4g-na.org/conference/schedule/session/2018-05-14). The reason it's for the last time is that the central conceipt it's built around, that a core decision is between a proprietary and an open source database, isn't really operative anymore. The real decisions are now being driven by other considerations, like cloud platforms, and the services available there. So, it's not really PostgreSQL vs Oracle anymore.

I also presented my "SQL Festival" talk, for the first time! New material is always a little challenging: will it work, is it the right level for the audience? It seemed to be well received, a mix of generic SQL tidbits, and some specific interesting queries you can do with PostGIS.
