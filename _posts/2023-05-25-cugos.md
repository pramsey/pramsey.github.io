Last month I was invited to give a keynote talk at the [CUGOS Spring Fling](https://cugos.org/2023-spring-fling/), a delightful gathering of "Cascadia Users of Open Source GIS" in Seattle. I have been speaking about open source economics at FOSS4G conferences more-or-less every two years, since 2009, and took this opportunity to somewhat revisit the topics of my [2019 FOSS4GNA keynote](/2019/05/foss4g-keynote-2019.html).
