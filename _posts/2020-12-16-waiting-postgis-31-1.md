------------

Open source developers sometimes have a hard time figuring out what feature to focus on, in order to generate the maximum value for end users. As a result, they will often default to **performance**. 

Performance is the one feature that every user approves of. The software will keep on doing all the same cool stuff, only faster.

For PostGIS 3.1, there have been a number of performance improvements that, taken together, might add up to a substantial performance gain for your workloads.

## Large Geometry Caching

Spatial joins have been slowed down by the overhead of large geometry access for a very long time.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.*
FROM A
JOIN B
ON ST_Intersects(A.geom, B.geom)
```

PostgreSQL will plan and execute spatial joins like this using a "nested loop join", which means iterating through one side of the join, and testing the join condition. This results in executions that look like:

* ST_Intersects(A.geom(1), B.geom(1))
* ST_Intersects(A.geom(1), B.geom(2))
* ST_Intersects(A.geom(1), B.geom(3))

So one side of the test repeats over and over.

Caching that side and avoiding re-reading the large object for each iteration of the loop makes a huge difference to performance. We have seen 20 times speed-ups in common spatial join workloads (see below).

The fixes are quite technical, but if you are interested [we have a detailed write-up available](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html).

## Header-only Geometry Reads

The on-disk format for geometry includes a short header that includes information about the geometry bounds, the spatial reference system and dimensionality. That means it's possible for some functions to return an answer after only reading a few bytes of the header, rather than the whole object.

However, not every function that *could* do a fast read, *did* do a fast read. That is now fixed.

## Faster Text Generation

It's pretty common for web applications and others to generate text formats inside the database, and the code for doing so was not optimized. Generating "well-known text" (WKT), GeoJSON, and KML output all now use a faster path and avoid unnecessary copying. 

PostGIS also now uses the same number-to-text code as PostgreSQL, which has been shown to be faster, and also allows us to expose a little more control over precision to end users.

# How Much Faster?

For the specific use case of spatially joining, here is my favourite test case:

* [1:10M Country Boundaries](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip)
* [1:10M Populated Places](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_populated_places.zip)

![Admin0 and Populated Places]({{ site.images }}/2020/admin0-places.png)

Load the data into both versions.

```bash
shp2pgsql -D -s 4326 -I ne_10m_admin_0_countries admin | psql postgis30
shp2pgsql -D -s 4326 -I ne_10m_populated_places places | psql postgis30
```

Run a spatial join that finds the sum of populated places in each country.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT Sum(p.pop_max) as pop_max, a.name
FROM admin a
JOIN places p
ON ST_Intersects(a.geom, p.geom)
GROUP BY a.name
```

Average time over 5 runs:

* PostGIS 3.0 = 23.4s
* PostGIS 3.1 =  0.9s

This test is somewhat of a "worst case", in that there are lots of very large countries in the admin data, but it gives an idea of the kind of speed-ups that are available for spatial joins against collections that include larger (250+ coordinates) geometries.
